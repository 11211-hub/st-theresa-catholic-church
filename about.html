                We are members of the St. Theresa family—a united community of faith, love, and service. 
                Rooted in the teachings of Christ and inspired by the example of St. Theresa, we journey together in prayer,
                 fellowship, and devotion to God. Our parish is more than a place of worship; 
                 it is a spiritual home where every member is welcomed, 
                 valued, and encouraged to grow in faith.

As one family in Christ, we support one another, share in one another’s joys and challenges, and commit ourselves to serving God and 
humanity. Through worship, sacraments, outreach, and active participation in parish life, we strive to live out the Gospel and be a light to our community and beyond.

Together, as members of the St. Theresa family, we continue to build a church founded on faith, hope, love, and unity.

                       At St. Theresa Catholic Church, we believe that church is more than a building—it is a family. 
                       Here, every member is welcomed, valued, and cherished.

                       Catholic culture is a rich tapestry of faith, tradition, and community that shapes the way we worship, live, and serve. At St. Theresa Catholic Church, we honor the teachings of Christ, 
                       the guidance of the Church, and the example of the saints as we grow in holiness together.

Our culture is expressed through prayer, the sacraments, music, liturgy, 
and celebration of feast days—creating a vibrant and nurturing environment for spiritual growth. 
It emphasizes love, compassion, service, and a commitment to justice, reflecting the life of Christ in every action.

In embracing Catholic culture, we connect with a timeless tradition that unites believers across the world,

                        <h6>Spirit Led Life</h6>

                        <p>
                      Living a Spirit-led life means allowing the Holy Spirit to guide our thoughts, decisions, 
                      and actions every day. At St. Theresa Catholic Church, 
                      we encourage our members to seek God’s direction through prayer, 
                      reflection, and discernment, 
                      trusting that the Spirit empowers us to live according to Christ’s teachings.

A Spirit-led life is marked by love, wisdom, humility, and service. 
It inspires us to walk in faith, embrace God’s purpose, and share His grace with others. 
By following the Spirit’s guidance, we grow closer to God, strengthen our community, 
and become a living witness of Christ’s love in the world.

                        <h6>The Creed.</h6>
                        <p>
                       I believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.

For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
and became man.

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.

I believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the world to come. Amen.
