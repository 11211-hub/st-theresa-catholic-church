                Discover a deeper sense of belonging by joining one of our parish societies. 
                Each society is a community of faith where members come together to pray, serve, 
                and support one another while contributing to the life and mission of the Church.

Joining a society allows you to use your gifts, develop spiritually, 
and build strong relationships rooted in shared values. No matter your age or background, 
there is a society where you can grow, serve, and feel at home.

Take the next step—get involved, grow in faith, and become an active part of our parish family.

                        <p>
                        Joining the Altar Knights is a special way for young children to serve God and 
                        grow closer to Him. 
                        As an Altar Knight, 
                        you learn how to assist during Mass, understand the meaning of the prayers, 
                        and take part in the sacred life of the Church from an early age.

Being an Altar Knight helps you grow in discipline, confidence, and responsibility. 
It teaches respect for the altar, obedience, teamwork, 
and good character—values that guide you both in church and in everyday life.

Most of all, it is a joyful experience. You make new friends, feel proud to serve at the altar, 
and discover that even at a young age, you have an important role in God’s family.

                        Altar Girls who dress the altar play a beautiful and reverent role in the life of the Church. 
                        Through their service, they help prepare the sacred space for Holy Mass, 
                        ensuring that everything is set with care, order, and respect for God’s presence.

This ministry teaches young girls the values of responsibility, attentiveness, and reverence. 
By assisting behind the scenes, they learn that serving God can be done quietly and faithfully, 
offering their time and effort as an act of love and worship.

Dressing the altar also helps them grow spiritually, deepen their understanding of the Mass, 
and feel a strong sense of belonging within the Church community. 
It is a meaningful way for young girls to serve God with humility, devotion, and joy.

                        leading the congregation in praise and lifting hearts to God through sacred music. 
                        Through song, the choir helps create a prayerful atmosphere during Mass and other liturgical celebrations, 
                        making worship more meaningful and inspiring.

Being part of the choir is both a ministry and a calling. 
Members grow spiritually as they use their voices and talents to glorify God, 
while also learning discipline, teamwork, and dedication. 
It is a place where faith and music come together in service.

The choir is open to all who love to sing and serve. 
By joining, you become part of a united group that worships God, 
enriches the liturgy, and strengthens the faith of the entire parish community.
